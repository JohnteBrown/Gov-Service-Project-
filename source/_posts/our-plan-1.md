### Why we preform our service.

Cyruss and I started our mission of enviromental preservation after seeing the vast impact that petrochemical plants, factories and deforestation had on the enviroment, the goal of our service isnt to stop industrial processes... but instead the goal is to raise awareness of the harms of these various industrial operations.

### Clean & Healthy Living.

Our Third and final goal is to make cities, villages and various suburban, rural and urban regions more safe from potential harmful polutents, We additionally aim to establish a reach internationally to handle aid missions all over the world. but first we have to start locally, which is what we are focusing on as of right now.
